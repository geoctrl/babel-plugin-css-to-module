# `babel-plugin-css-to-module`

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/babel-plugin-css-to-module.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/babel-plugin-css-to-module)

Transform css strings into css-modules using tagged template literals.

### The old way

You would write css in its own file and import it into your component using a
module bundler like webpack and the loader `css-loader` to convert it to css
modules:

```css
/* my-styles.css */
.someStyle {
  background-color: red;
}
```

```jsx
// my-component.js
<div className={styles.someStyle}>Hello, world!</div>
```

### The new way

`babel-plugin-css-to-module` allows you to write your css as a template literal
in your javascript file:

```jsx
<div className={styles.someStyle}>Hello, world!</div>;

const { styles } = cssModules`
  .someStyle {
    background-color: red;
  }
`;
```

## Install

This plugin uses [postcss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss), and requires
it as a peer dependency.

```shell
yarn add -D postcss babel-plugin-css-to-module
# or
npm install -D postcss babel-plugin-css-to-module
```

Add plugin to your babel config

```javascript
// babel.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    [
      "babel-plugin-css-to-module",
      {
        // options here
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

## Use

While `babel-plugin-css-to-module` transforms your css to modules, we now need a
way to consume it. This depends highly on your setup and chosen libraries.
For our use-case we built a library for react:
[inline-css-modules-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inline-css-modules-react).

## Options

### `tagName`

`string`

This plugin works by targeting and transforming specifically named template
literal tags. By default, all template literals named `cssModules` will be
processed. This can be overridden using the `tagName` option.

```javascript
// babel.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    [
      "babel-plugin-css-to-module",
      {
        // options here
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

```js
const { styles } = customName`
  .test {
    background-color: red;
  }
`;
```

### `postcssPlugins`

`postcssPlugins` is a passthrough option for postcss plugins. The order of
plugins will be:

`[...passedInPlugins, cssModulePlugin()]`.

### `sassOptions`

`{ additionalData: string; ...restOfSassOptions }`

Because I'm partial to Sass ðŸ˜‰, I've added the ability to run your css through
the Sass engine before being transformed. To enable this, install
[sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) and add `sassOptions` to
your babel config (object):

```shell
# install sass
yarn add -D sass
```

```javascript
// babel.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    [
      "babel-plugin-css-to-module",
      {
        sassOptions: {
          additionalData: "",
          ...restOfSassOptions,
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

The `additionalData` sass option will prepend any sass to the
beginning of your stylesheets (think variables and mixins).

The rest of the properties are pass-through options for sass, and can be found
in their
docs: [sass javascript api](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/js-api/).

**Note:** even if you don't need sass options, you still need to include
the `sassOptions` property for the sass compiler to run.

### postcssPlugins
